# curve-editor
Essential package providing editor scripts to modify curve data

## Curve Redistribution
Have you ever wondered, how other developers integrate their curve data into other projects.
- Re-typing everything is very time-consuming.
- Implementing a solution providing an interchangeable data format and custom loaders might be over the top.
- Copying scripts into the Assets folder of the new project will only presevere the default data.
- Duplicating whole projects would introduce needless data. Simultaneously it makes it even more difficult to used curve data from multiple projects

The easiest way, I can imagine, is to export and import scriptable objects. These objects should be placed inside an <i>Editor</i> folder to avoid inflating the project's build size.

Moreover developers can create sets of reliable curves which should be reused in upcoming projects.
